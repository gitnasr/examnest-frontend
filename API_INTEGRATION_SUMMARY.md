  - Contains all DTOs from the API specification
  - Includes extended models with additional properties
  - Defines enums, response wrappers, and pagination interfaces
  - Consolidates all interfaces in one place for easy maintenance

### 2. Complete Service Layer
All services have been created or updated with consistent patterns:

#### Core Services
- ✅ **ApiService** - Base HTTP service with error handling
- ✅ **AuthService** - Authentication, token management, user session
- ✅ **UserService** - User profile operations

#### Entity Services
- ✅ **BranchService** - Branch CRUD operations
- ✅ **TrackService** - Track CRUD operations  
- ✅ **CourseService** - Course CRUD operations
- ✅ **QuestionBankService** - Question bank CRUD operations

- ✅ **SubmissionService** - Exam submission CRUD and details

### 3. Service Organization
- **Created**: `src/app/shared/services/index.ts`
  - Exports all services for easy importing
  - Organized by functionality
  - Provides clean import paths

### 4. Interface Organization
- **Created**: `src/app/shared/interfaces/index.ts`
  - Exports all interfaces from the comprehensive API interface file
  - Provides single import point for all types

### 5. Documentation
- **Created**: `src/app/shared/services/README.md`
  - Comprehensive documentation of all services
  - Usage examples for common operations
  - Error handling guidelines
  - Best practices and security features

## Usage Examples

### Basic Service Usage
```typescript
import { AuthService, BranchService, ExamService } from '@shared/services';

// Authentication
this.authService.login({ email: 'user@example.com', password: 'password' })
  .subscribe({
    next: (response) => console.log('Login successful'),
    error: (error) => console.error('Login failed', error)
  });

// Get paginated data
this.branchService.getBranches(1)
  .subscribe({
    next: (response) => console.log('Branches:', response.data),
    error: (error) => console.error('Failed to fetch branches', error)
  });

// Create entity
this.examService.createExam({
  courseId: 1,
  noOfQuestions: 10,
  examDate: '2024-01-15T10:00:00Z',
  endDate: '2024-01-15T12:00:00Z'
})
  .subscribe({
    next: (exam) => console.log('Exam created:', exam),
    error: (error) => console.error('Failed to create exam', error)
  });
```

## Next Steps

1. **Component Integration**: Use these services in your Angular components
2. **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling in your app
3. **Loading States**: Add loading indicators for API calls
4. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all services
6. **Environment Configuration**: Set up different API URLs for development/production
