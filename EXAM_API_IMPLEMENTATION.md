# Exam Taking API Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the exam taking functionality for the ExamNest frontend application.

## Overview

The exam taking system allows students to take exams and instructors to create and manage exams. The implementation includes:

- **Student Features**: Exam entry, exam taking, and results viewing
- **Instructor Features**: Exam creation and management
- **API Integration**: Full integration with the ExamNest backend API

## Architecture

### Shared Services

#### 1. Exam Service (`src/app/shared/services/exam.service.ts`)
Handles all exam-related API operations:

- `getExams(page)` - Get paginated list of exams
- `getExamById(id)` - Get specific exam details
- `getExamDisplay(id)` - Get exam questions for taking
- `createExam(payload)` - Create new exam (instructor only)
- `updateExam(id, examDate, endDate)` - Update exam dates
- `deleteExam(id)` - Delete exam (instructor only)
- `getStudentResults(studentId, examId)` - Get student exam results
- `getSubmissions(page)` - Get paginated submissions
- `getSubmissionDetails(id)` - Get detailed submission information
- `submitExam(payload)` - Submit exam answers

#### 2. Course Service (`src/app/shared/services/course.service.ts`)
Handles course-related API operations:

- `getCourses(page)` - Get paginated list of courses
- `getCourseById(id)` - Get specific course details
- `createCourse(data)` - Create new course
- `updateCourse(id, data)` - Update course
- `deleteCourse(id)` - Delete course

### Data Interfaces

#### Exam Interfaces (`src/app/shared/interfaces/exam.interface.ts`)

```typescript
interface ExamCreatePayload {
  courseId: number;
  noOfQuestions: number;
  examDate: string;
  endDate: string;
}

interface ExamAnswerDTO {
  questionID: number;
  studentAnswer: string;
}

interface SubmissionPayload {
  examID: number;
  answers: ExamAnswerDTO[];
}

interface QuestionBank {
  questionId: number;
  questionText: string;
  questionType: string;
  modelAnswer?: string;
  points: number;
  choices?: Choice[];
}

interface Choice {
  questionId: number;
  choiceLetter: string;
  choiceText: string;
}

interface ExamDisplayResponse {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data: QuestionBank[];
  errors?: string[] | null;
}

interface StudentResult {
  studentId: number;
  examId: number;
  score: number;
  totalQuestions: number;
  correctAnswers: number;
  submissionDate: string;
}
```

## API Response Structure

### Exam Display Endpoint (`GET /api/Exams/{id}/display`)

The exam display endpoint returns questions directly in the following format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Success",
  "data": [
    {
      "questionId": 18,
      "questionText": "Eos ut voluptatem.",
      "questionType": "MCQ",
      "choices": [
        {
          "questionId": 18,
          "choiceLetter": "A",
          "choiceText": "Corrupti voluptatum qui culpa eaque quibusdam cum."
        },
        {
          "questionId": 18,
          "choiceLetter": "B",
          "choiceText": "Molestiae velit doloribus."
        }
      ],
      "points": 5
    }
  ],
  "errors": null
